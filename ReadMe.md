What's Michonne?
==============

__*"No lock... no deadlock!"*__  Michonne is a library that allows you __to erradicate deadlocks within your applicative code__ by providing you composable behaviors for tasks/lambdas execution (i.e. dispatcher, sequencer, balking dispatcher, etc), in replacement of locks and raw TPL primitives that will lead you to deadlocks.
